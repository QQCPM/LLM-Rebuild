Thunder rolling in the night
Chasing shadows, running from the light
Every step I take feels wrong or right
In this endless fight

[Chorus]
We're breaking free from all the chains
Rising up through all the pain
Nothing left for us to lose
This path we choose

[Verse 2]
Fire burning in my soul
Taking back what they once stole
Never gonna play their role
I'm in control

[Chorus]
We're breaking free from all the chains
Rising up through all the pain
Nothing left for us to lose
This path we choose

[Bridge]
Scream it loud, scream it true
I'm not done, not through
This is my revolution
My resolution

[Chorus]
We're breaking free from all the chains
Rising up through all the pain
Nothing left for us to lose
This path we choose

Dirt road running past the old oak tree
Where we carved our names for the world to see
That pickup truck still runs but barely
Takes me back to memories

[Chorus]
Take me home to where I belong
Where the nights are warm and the love is strong
Simple life and a country song
That's where my heart's been all along

[Verse 2]
Mama's cookin' and daddy's pride
Front porch swing on a summer night
Stars above shining bright and wide
That small town life

Take me home to where I belong
Where the nights are warm and the love is strong
Simple life and a country song
That's where my heart's been all along

City lights can't compare
To that sweet country air
That's my home, that's my prayer
I'll meet you there

Take me home to where I belong
Where the nights are warm and the love is strong
Simple life and a country song
That's where my heart's been all along

Started from the bottom with a dollar and a dream
Nothing ever easy, nothing's quite as it seems
Working through the struggle, building up my team
Now we're living large, living like a king

We made it through the hard times
Now we're living in the spotlight
Started with nothing, now we got everything
This is our time, this is our life

Every single setback made me stronger than before
Every closed window led me to an open door
Haters gonna hate but I just keep wanting more
Rising to the top, that's what I'm aiming for

We made it through the hard times
Now we're living in the spotlight
Started with nothing, now we got everything
This is our time, this is our life

[Verse 3]
Looking back at where I came from, how far I've grown
Turned my dreams into reality, made this path my own
Never giving up, that's the only thing I've known
Now I'm sitting here on my throne

[Hook]
We made it through the hard times
Now we're living in the spotlight
Started with nothing, now we got everything
This is our time, this is our life
