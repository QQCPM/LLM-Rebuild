## 📝 **Data Format Examples**

### **Format Your Training Data Like This:**

```
[Verse 1]
Walking down the street on a sunny day
Got a smile on my face, got nothing to say
The world keeps turning, life goes on
Before you know it, the moment's gone

[Chorus]
We're just dancing in the rain
Washing away all the pain
Living for today, not tomorrow
Forget about the sorrow

[Verse 2]
Remember when we were young and free
No worries, no cares, just you and me
The nights were long, the days were bright
We'd stay up talking 'til morning light

[Chorus]
We're just dancing in the rain
Washing away all the pain
Living for today, not tomorrow
Forget about the sorrow

[Bridge]
Time moves fast, but memories last
Hold on tight to the present, don't live in the past

[Chorus]
We're just dancing in the rain
Washing away all the pain
Living for today, not tomorrow
Forget about the sorrow
```

**Key elements:**
- Use `[Verse 1]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]` tags
- Maintain consistent structure

|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------|----------|
| **Small** | 3-5M | 2 hours | Good | Testing, simple lyrics |
| **Medium** | 10-15M | 8 hours | Very good | Most genres |
| **Large** | 25-50M | 1-2 days | Excellent | Complex styles, rap |

## 💡 **Tips for Better Lyrics**

### **1. Training Data Quality Matters**

**Good data:**
- ✅ 1000+ songs
- ✅ Consistent formatting
- ✅ Clear structure markers
- ✅ One genre OR mixed genres (your choice)
- ✅ High-quality lyrics (avoid nonsense)

**Bad data:**
- ❌ Only 50 songs
- ❌ Messy formatting
- ❌ No structure
- ❌ Multiple languages mixed
- ❌ Low-quality/incomplete lyrics

### **2. Prompt Engineering**

**Good prompts:**
```
"[Verse 1]"
"[Chorus]"
"Love is like"
"I remember when"
"Tonight we're gonna"
```

**Great prompts (with style):**
```
"[Genre: Pop] [Theme: Heartbreak] [Verse 1]"
"[Genre: Rap] [Theme: Success] [Hook]"
"[Mood: Happy] [Chorus]"
```

### **3. Temperature Settings**

```bash
# In generate_interactive.py
Temperature = 0.7  # Consistent, predictable
Temperature = 0.9  # Creative, varied (RECOMMENDED for lyrics)
Temperature = 1.1  # Wild, experimental
Temperature = 0.5  # Boring, repetitive
```

**For lyrics: Use 0.8-1.0 for best creativity!**
